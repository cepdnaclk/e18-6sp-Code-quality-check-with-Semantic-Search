  #  CODE QUALITY CHECK WITH SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
___

## Problem Definition
Problems in Manual code reviews
+ Time consuming
+ Difficult and Subjective
+ Prone to Human errors

Problems with existing static code quality checkers
+ Limited Contextual Understanding and Evaluation
+ Difficulty in handling code complexity
+ Limited detection of design issues and language dependent



## Aim
Design and develop a Machine learning model which is trained with a lot of data, which can understand the quality of code in a much more deeper way than ruled based static code quality checkers and evaluate code as good or bad.
